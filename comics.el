;;; Commentary:
;;
;; QUICK INTRO:
;; ============
;;
;; This package should work for Emacs versions 21.1 and up.
;;
;; comics.el provides a way to view and store comics that are available
;; on the web.  A list of favorite comics can be kept.
;;
;; To simply read a comic:
;; M-x comics-read-comic
;;     You will be prompted for a comic to read (with tab completion).
;;     With a numeric argument, the comic will be from that many days ago.
;;     With a non-numeric argument (such as C-u M-x comics-read-comic), you will
;;     be prompted for a date (in the form YYYYMMDD).
;;     In the buffer displaying the comic, the following commands are
;;     available:
;;
;; To get a list of all available comics:
;; M-x comics-list-comics
;;     You will be given a buffer with the categories of the available
;;     comics.  (Currently the categories are just the letters that the
;;     comics start with.)  Comics that have been chosen as favorites
;;     will be in bold.  The following commands will allow you to 
;;     sort through the categories:
;;     TAB     will toggle the display of the comics in the current category.
;;     C-cC-e  will expand all the categories (display all the comics)
;;     C-cC-h  will hide all the categories.
;;
;; Favorite comics:
;; Favorite comics can be read separately, and information about them
;; can be kept.  comics.el will keep track of which dates the favorites
;; comics have been read (starting with the date they were entered as
;; favorites).
;; To get a list of comics that have been chosen as favorites:
;; M-x comics-favorites-list-comics
;;     By default, the comics will be in alphabetical order.
;;     If the customizable variable `comics-favorites-alphabetical' is
;;     nil, then they won't necessarily be in order.  The order can then
;;     be adjusted with the following commands:
;;     C-cC-a  will put the comics in alphabetical order.
;;     C-k     will kill the current comic from the favorite comics list.
;;     C-y     will yank a killed comic to the favorites comics list.
;;
;; Bookmarks:
;; Bookmarks are a way of keeping track of particular comics.
;; Each comic can have a (default) bookmark, to make it easy to return 
;; to a particular date.  Comics can have more than one bookmark, by 
;; giving them names. (The default bookmark corresponds to the name "".)
;; There are global bookmarks, which aren't attached to any comic, but 
;; contain the comic information inside.  There is also a default global bookmark.
;;
;; Commands:
;; The following commands are available (as appropriate) in all comics
;; related buffers (the buffers displaying the comics as well as the buffers
;; with the lists of comics).  The "current comic" is the comic being viewed
;; or the comic on the current line.
;;  d        View the comic from a prompted-for date
;;  D        Download the comic from a prompted-for date
;;  g        View the comic at the default bookmark
;;           With an argument, prompt for a bookmark name
;;  G        View the comic at the default global bookmark
;;           With an argument, prompt for a bookmark name
;;  C-cC-b   Delete a bookmark
;;  C-cC-g   Delete a global bookmark
;;  f        Add the current comic to the favorites list.
;;           With an argument, prompt for a percent to resize the comic
;;           when it is displayed.  (A "t" here will have the comic
;;           resized to fill the buffer when opened.)
;;  C        Tell comics that all dates of all favorite comics have been read.
;;  l        Switch to a buffer containing the list of favorite
;;           comics.  Create one if necessary.
;;  C-cC-f   Download all the current favorite comics.
;;  C-cC-u   Download all the unread favorite comics.
;;  L        Switch to a buffer containing the list of available
;;           comics.  Create one if necessary.
;;  q        Bury the comic related buffers.
;;  k        Kill all the comics buffers
;;  K        Kill all the comic related buffers (comics and comic lists)
;;
;; When the current comic is a favorite, the following are also available:
;;  c        Tell comics that all dates of the current comic have been read.
;;  C-cC-r   Change the default resizing information for the current comic.
;;  C-cC-k   Remove the current comic from the favorites list.
;;
;; The following commands are available in the buffer displaying a comic:
;;  n        View the comic from the next day
;;           (with argument N, view the comic from N days forward)
;;  N        View the comic from the next day, skipping missing days
;;  p        View the comic from the previous day
;;           (with argument N, view the comic from P days previous)
;;  P        View the comic from the previous day, skipping missing days
;;  b        Set this comic as the default bookmark
;;           With an argument (C-u b), prompt for a name for
;;           the bookmark
;;  B        Set this comic as the default global bookmark
;;           With an argument (C-u b), prompt for a name for
;;           the bookmark
;;  DEL      Delete the comic file
;;  SPC      Read the next unread date (if the current comic is a favorite)
;;  u        Copy the URL of the comic to the kill ring.
;;  i        Copy the information (title, author, date) of the
;;           comic to the kill ring.
;;  U        Copy the URL and info to the kill ring.
;;  D        Copy (Duplicate) the comic file to a prompted-for file.
;;  C-cC-v   View the comic in an external viewer
;; If the variable `comics-buffer-resize' is non-nil and "convert"
;; from the ImageMagick(TM) utilities is installed, then the following 
;; commands are also available.
;;  F        Fit the comic to fill the buffer
;;  R        Resize the comic to a percentage of its current size
;;           (The percentage can be given as a prefix, or it will
;;           be prompted for.)
;;  O        Restore the comic to its original size.
;; This has been tested with version 6.2.6 of the ImageMagick(TM) 
;; utilities; it may work with some older versions.
;; ImageMagick(TM) is free software which is available at
;; http://www.imagemagick.org/
;;
;; The following commands are available in the buffers containing lists
;; of comics:
;;  r or RET  Read the comic on the current line.
;;            With a numeric argument, the comic will be from that many
;;            days before.
;;            With a non-numeric argument (such as C-u M-x comics-read-comic), 
;;            you will be prompted for a date (in the form YYYYMMDD).
;;            If the point is on a category line, toggle the display of
;;            the comics in the category.
;;  R or F    Like "r", but only downloads the comic (it doesn't display it).
;;  C-cC-d    Download the current comic and as many back strips as possible.
;;            With argument N, download N comics.
;;
;; 
;; NOTE:  The list `comics-list' is used for completion and getting 
;;        information for downloading the comics.  It is defined
;;        using the initial value of `comics-categorized-list'.
;;        If `comics-categorized-list' is changed after "comics"
;;        is loaded, `comics-list' won't match `comics-categorized-list'.
;;        If `comics-categorized-list' is made smaller, this isn't a
;;        problem, but if new comics are added to `comics-categorized-list'
;;        after "comics" is loaded, the function `comics-update-comics-list'
;;        should be run.
;;
;; To you these commands, it may be useful to put
;;  (autoload 'comics-read-comic "comics" "Read a comic." t)
;;  (autoload 'comics-favorites-list-comics "comics"
;;            "Go to a list of favorite comics." t)
;; in your .emacs

;;              If a number, it will be number of hours to adjust today's 
;;              day by when computing today; comics will regard today as

;;     With an argument, prompt for a percent to resize the comic
;;     when it is displayed.  (A "t" here will have the comic
;;     resized to fill the buffer when opened.)
;;     (If the customizable variable `comics-get-storage-info' is
;;      non-nil, then this will also prompt for information on how
;;      to store the comic.  Entering a "D" will put the comic
;;      in a separate subdirectory, otherwise it will be stored in the
;;      default comics directory, and "L" will save the comic with
;;      the date written out, otherwise the comics will be saved with

;;     This will download a copy of the comics listed in the favorite
;;     comics list.
;; M-x comics-fetch-this-comic-back
;;     This will prompt you for a comic, then retrieve the current strip
;;     and as many older strips as it can.  The variable
;;     `comics-fetch-misses-allowed' will determine how many days in
;;     a row comics can fail to fetch a comic before it decides it's done.
;;     With arg N, fetch comics that many days back.
;; M-x comics-fetch-favorite-comics-back
;;     This will retrieve the current favorite comics and as many older 
;;     strips as it can.  With arg N, fetch comics that many days back.

;;
;; NOTE:  If any of these comics are no longer available, or if there
;;        are ideas for more comics, please let me know so I can
;;        keep the list up-to-date.
;;        Please let me know of any other suggestions, bugs, comments,...
;;        belanger@truman.edu
;;
;; ANOTHER NOTE:  With the addition of the ability to keep track of dates on which the
;;        favorites have been read, the format of the comics-favorites list has 
;;        changed slightly.  If you didn't have storage information in the 
;;        comics-favorites list and simply had the comic names, the difference
;;        won't matter, otherwise you might wish to edit .comics-favorites and
;;        change entries like ("Comic Name" "D") to ("Comic Name" nil nil "D").
;;
;; CHANGES:
;;
;; 24 August 2009
;;
;; Added a variable, `comics-show-title', which if non-nil will cause the
;; comic title and author to appear in the comic buffer.  By default it
;; is nil.
;;
;; 20 August 2009
;;
;; Added "Girl Genius"
;;
;; 23 Feb 2009
;;
;; Fixed bug in `comics-favorites-catch-up-comic'
;;
;; 11 Feb 2009
;;
;; Fixed Piled Higher and Deeper.
;; (Patch by Dr. Reimar Finken)
;;
;; 7 Feb 2009
;;
;; Fixed kingfeatures comics.
;;
;; 12 Jan 2009
;; Fixed comics.com comics, dilbert.
;;
;; 17 Feb 2007
;; Fix a problem downloading Xkcd.
;;
;; Add "D" binding to comics-buffer, which will copy the file for the current 
;; comic.
;;
;; Increase `comics-fetch-misses-allowed' to 7
;; If date of favorite comic being read is earlier than the earliest date,
;; don't add it to the dates-read list.
;; Add ShortPacked and Zippy.
;; Add "N" and "P" keybindings for comics buffers, which will read the next 
;; or previous comic, but skip any dates in which the comic cannot be obtained.  
;; (The most days skipped will be `comics-fetch-misses-allowed'.
;;
;; Some keybinding changes.
;; Remove fetch-only buffers.
;;
;; Now keeps track of which days the favorite comics have been read.
;; Resizing information can be kept on a per-comic basis.
;; (Suggested by Andy Scott.)
;;
;; Added the customizable variable `comics-buffer-resize-on-open'.
;; If t, this will cause the comic to fill the buffer when open.
;; If a number, this will cause the comic to be resized by that
;; percentage when opened.
;;
;; Add a "c" binding to calendar that will prompt for a comic 
;; to display.
;;
;; SPC will sequence through the unread favorite comics.
;; (Suggested by Andy Scott.)
;; If your favorites list contains extra storage information, such
;; as ("Comic Name" "D"), then that needs to be changed to
;; ("Comic Name" nil "D").  If you never put extra storage 
;; information in, then you don't need to worry about this.
;;
;; Use `comics-bury-comic-related-buffers' to bury buffers.
;;
;; Add bindings "k" and "K" to all comic related buffers.  These
;; will kill all comic/comic related buffers.
;;
;; Add bindings "l" and "L" to comics buffer, to go to the list of
;; favorite or all comics, respectively.
;; Add bindings "u" and "i", to copy URL and information, respectively,
;; of comic to kill ring.
;; Suggested by Andy Scott.
;;
;; Change resizing keys "f" and "r" to "F" and "R" in comics buffer.
;; Use "f" and "r" for adding and removing from favorites list.
;; Use `ido' completion when available.
;; Many other fixes and improvements.
;; Suggested by Andy Scott.
;;
;; Changed `comics-select-list' to `comics-favorites-list' and changed
;; the format.  This is no longer customizable, instead commands
;; are made to add or remove comics from the list.
;; Also, a buffer list for the favorite comics was added.  (See the
;; intro above.)
;;
;; More fixes and cleanups due to Detlev Zundel.
;;
;; Made modes for the comics buffer and the comics list buffers.
;; Information on the keybindings can now be gotten with 
;; C-hm (describe mode).  "h" and "?" in the comics-buffer now
;; calls describe-mode.
;; (Suggested by Detlev Zundel.)
;;
;; Added some interactive help in the browsing mode.
;; (Due to Detlev Zundel)
;; In the comics-buffer, "h" and "?" will give a list of available keys.
;;
;; Added comics-kill-comics-buffers
;;
;; Added a simple test to check if a downloaded Snoopy comic is really
;; a comic.
;;
;; Added a simple test to make sure the downloaded file is an image.
;;
;; Added Snoopy from Japan.
;;
;; Added some messages for fetching comics.
;;
;; Added the customizable variables 
;;  comics-filename-long-date
;;       If non-nil, use the `2004_August_01' form of the date in file
;;       names, otherwise use `2004_08_01'.  (The latter form will 
;;       the calender order the same as alphabetical order.)
;;  comics-use-separate-comic-directories
;;       If non-nil, each comic strip series will have its own 
;;       subdirectory of `comics-dir', otherwise all comics are
;;       in the same directory.
;;
;; Some bug fixes.
;;
;; Added the customizable variable:
;;  comics-adjust-current-time:
;;      This determines what date to use when trying to fetch a
;;      current comic.  If this variable is `t', then comics.el
;;      uses the current date at the website (based on a guess 
;;      of which time zone it is in).  If this variable is a number,
;;      that number of hours will be added to the current time 
;;      and that date will be used.  (So if you think the websites 
;;      are a couple of time zones away, you could set this to 2...)
;;      If this variable is nil, simply find the current date where you
;;      are at.
;;      This is an attempt to deal with the problem of looking for
;;      current comics when, because of time zone differences, it is
;;      a different day at your computer and the web site, so you wouldn't
;;      be able to download the "current" comic.
;;      It only applies when you are trying to get only a current comic,
;;      (comics-read-comic, comics-fetch-comic, comics-fetch-all-comics,
;;      comics-fetch-some-comics), and if the functions are given an 
;;      argument of "-" (C-u - M-x comics-read-comic), then there will be
;;      no attempts to adjust the time.
;;      I couldn't test this out very well, so if there are any problems
;;      with it, please let me know immediately so I can fix it.
;;      Thanks
;;
;; Added global bookmarks.
;; (Note that some bookmark bindings were changed)
;;
;; Added bookmarks.
;;
;; Added some resizing commands
;;
;; Added some new keys to the comic buffer keymap
;;
;; Added a face for the comics categories.
;; Changed how faces were applied.
;;
;; Created different faces for various parts of the buffer.
;; (Comic titles, dates, instructions, ...)
;; Added some keys to help move around in the list buffers.
;;
;; Fixed a few keymap problems.
;; Then, created distinct keymaps for the different buffers that
;; are created.

"This is a list of so-called comic categories.
Each category is a list beginning with a string (the name), followed by 
sublists of comics in that category.
Each sublist must consist of 
NAME      The name of the strip
AUTHOR    The author of the strip (or \"\")
FILENAME  A name to use in the construction of the file name
FUNCTION  A function which will fetch the strip and return the name
          of the fetched file, or nil if it cannot fetch it.  
          Any necessary arguments can follow.")
;;; This last function must take an optional last argument,
;;; which if non-nil and not "-" should be of the form
;;; YYYYMMDD and will return the strip from that day.
;;; If only the latest edition of the cartoon can be reliably 
;;; retrieved, then the function should return the string 
;;; "onlylatest" if called with an argument (besides "-").
;;; If the date YYYYMMDD is needed by the function, it should
;;; computed with (comics-use-date date timezone)
;;; where date is the optional argument of the function and
;;; timezone is a string indicating which time zone the web site
;;; is.  (See comics-world-timezones).  If date is a date, then
;;; comics-use-date will return the date.  If date is nil,
;;; the comics-use-date will return the current date at the given
;;; timezone, and if date is "-", the comics-use-date will 
;;; return the date at the computer being used.
;;; Any net comic getting functions should be added to 
;;; `comics-get-comics-timezone-list'.
